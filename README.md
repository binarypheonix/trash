# TRASH
_A **TR**uly **A**wesome **SH**ell, in Rust!_

## About
TRASH, as you may have guessed, stands for Truly Awesome Shell, which is a simple shell implementation in Rust
with support for piping. Other features will be added later on when I feel like it, or if you're interested, you
could open an issue for the feature you want, or create a PR for the same.

# Installation

To install the shell and play with it, simply clone the repo, and build the trash.rs file in src directory.

> Note: You will need the Rust Compiler (rustc) installed on your system before building the source.
> If you don't have it already, install it using the offcial Rustup toolchain:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
or follow the instructions given at [The Official Rust Install Page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)

To build and execute Trash, use the following commands:
```
cd <to-target-dir>
git clone https://github.com/binarypheonix/trash.git
cd src
rustc trash.rs
./trash
```
To make TRASH your default shell, add the executable to your local bin and set it as default in your Terminal Preferences.
